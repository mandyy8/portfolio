											<h3><strong>Why help others?</strong></h3>
											<p>Growing up as a first generation Asian-American immigrant with only Chinese speaking parents taught me the important of independence at a young age. I had to learn how to do many things on my own.</p>
								            <p>So, when people helped me while expecting nothing back in my most difficult times, I felt supported and like I could take on the whole world. Life can be pretty short, but a legacy lasts forever. In order to pass it forward, my goal is to help other's find their meaning and make change, so my knowledge lives on beyond what I've personally done. </p>

												<h3><strong>Interests</strong></h3>
												<p>✦ Aquatics - I've been swimming since I was 5 and picked up water polo in high school!</p>
												<p>✦ Reading - To stop mindless scrolling on social media, I picked up reading thriller and mystery books instead!</p>
												<p>✦ Personal growth - I really enjoy developing new small positive habits, since they can compound dramatically in the future! </p>
											    <p>✦ Design - I can spend a unreasonable amount of time reordering and designing my phone screen or decorating my things.   </p>

												<h3><strong>Fun Facts:</strong></h3>
												<p>✧ I really like quotes!</p>
												<p>✧ My favorite color is purple (my resume is also purple). </p>
												<p>✧ I taught myself how to code html and this website is my first big project!</p>
												<p>✧ I was the only girl in my advanced computer science class for the whole school year, but I was still comfortable and learned really well. </p>
												<p>✧ One of my favorite ways to relax is to go hiking or biking, turn off my phone, and just be in the moment ✨ </p>
